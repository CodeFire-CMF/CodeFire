Introduction
------------

CodeFire is a CMF built on [laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel "Laravel PHP Framework"). Since laravel uses composer, CF took this chance to use libraries from others that are working perfectly fine together - That means, we do not reinvent the wheel each time again!


Why CodeFire?
-------------

Although there are other CMS' and CMFs out there, none of that did really do what we wanted. A CMF should just focus access management (users, groups and permissions) the pages (including media content) and the extensions (modules and templates).
That means, that CF is not providing you with a working blog or bulletin system, not even simple user notifications/PMs! You can extend and build the website like **you** want, while you are not limited to the capabilities of the framework.

Extensions
----------

There are two types of extensions: Modules and templates. Modules extend the backend and mechanic of your site, while templates give your frontend the looks you want.

How to Use
----------

Just download the CodeFire framework from one of the provided links and open the ``index.php`` in your browser. Just follow the basic steps (like database connection) and you're ready to go!
